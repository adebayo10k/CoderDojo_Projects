##CoderDojo Projects Repository
========

###Welcome.

The purpose of this GitHub repository is to be a source of project resources and ideas for _anyone_ involved in CoderDojo or Code Club type activities..

Feel free to download or fork any of the work contained here. Some of these projects may be updated over time.


####Volunteer Mentoring

As CoderDojo mentors we try to encourage that problem solving mindset ... coming up with project ideas and testing out ideas, runs alongside understanding the software, hardware and conceptual tools.

**Getting creative** by solving problems and learning that we CAN solve problems is what I think developing is all about.

Projects generally start with a _problem scenario_, then go though the steps leading to a solution.

So, here are some of the projects we've worked on so far...
The solutions discovered here are best used as references.

####Morse Code
![CoderDojo Morse Code workbook cover sheet](morse_project/resources/morse_alphabet_and_numbers_w250.png)

This requires ninjas to program micro:bit to be a Morse Code transceiver, both transmitting and receiving signals. At the same time, mentors and volunteers have to program other morse-speaking micro:bit 'characters' with which code ninjas must interact and be tested. These include:

Messenger Challenge - Outputs Morse messages, which ninjas must work in teams to decode.

Echo Challenge - Displays random alphanumeric characters, to which ninjas must successfully respond in Morse.

The Channel Administrator - Able to control to radio communication channel of Echo Challenge.
The Translator - Able to decode user input Morse signals into alphanumeric characters.

####Emotion Communicator
This project was created to support Autism Awareness Week. 
Ninjas program one of two micro:bit devices. The first (Emotion Transmitter) communicating an emotion being experienced, the other (Emotion Receiver)acknowledging that communication.
```

```
####Recycling Tally Counter
This Project presents a recycling challenge scenario. 
Ninjas are told that Leeds City Council have asked our dojo to provide a device that can help count how many metal cans are recyled each day in their offices. The challenge progresses to include plastic bottles and paper cups.
